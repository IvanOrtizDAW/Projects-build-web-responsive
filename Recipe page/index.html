        <h3>Instructions</h3>

        <span class="material-icons orange600"> looks_one </span> Adjust the
        oven rack to the lower-middle position and preheat oven to 350°F
        (177°C).
        <br />
        <span class="material-icons orange600"> looks_two </span>
        <span>Make the crust</span>: Using a food processor, pulse the graham
        crackers into crumbs. Pour into a medium bowl and stir in sugar and
        melted butter until combined. (You can also pulse it all together in the
        food processor.) Mixture will be sandy. Press firmly into the bottom and
        slightly up the sides of a 9-inch or 10-inch springform pan. No need to
        grease the pan first. I use the bottom of a measuring cup to pack the
        crust down tightly. Pre-bake for 8 minutes. Remove from the oven and
        place the hot pan on a large piece of aluminum foil. The foil will wrap
        around the pan for the water bath in step 4. Allow crust to slightly
        cool as you prepare the filling.
        <br />
        <span class="material-icons orange600"> looks_3 </span>
        <span>Make the filling</span>: Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted
        with a paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese and granulated sugar
        together on medium-high speed in a large bowl until the mixture is
        smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the sour cream, vanilla extract,
        and lemon juice then beat until fully combined. On medium speed, add the
        eggs one at a time, beating after each addition until just blended.
        After the final egg is incorporated into the batter, stop mixing. To
        help prevent the cheesecake from deflating and cracking as it cools,
        avoid over-mixing the batter as best you can.
        <br />
        <span class="material-icons orange600"> looks_4 </span>
        <span>Prepare the simple water bath (see note)</span> Boil a pot of
        water. You need 1 inch of water in your roasting pan for the water bath,
        so make sure you boil enough. I use an entire kettle of hot water. As
        the water is heating up, wrap the aluminum foil around the springform
        pan. Pour the cheesecake batter on top of the crust. Use a rubber
        spatula or spoon to smooth it into an even layer. Place the pan inside
        of a large roasting pan. Carefully pour the hot water inside of the pan
        and place in the oven. (Or you can place the roasting pan in the oven
        first, then pour the hot water in. Whichever is easier for you.)
        <br />
        <span class="material-icons orange600"> looks_5 </span> Bake cheesecake
        for 55-70 minutes or until the center is almost set. When it’s done, the
        center of the cheesecake will slightly wobble if you gently shake the
        pan. Turn the oven off and open the oven door slightly. Let the
        cheesecake sit in the oven in the water bath as it cools down for 1
        hour. Remove from the oven and water bath, then cool cheesecake
        completely at room temperature. Then refrigerate the cheesecake for at
        least 4 hours or overnight.
        <br />
        <span class="material-icons orange600"> looks_6 </span> Use a knife to
        loosen the chilled cheesecake from the rim of the springform pan, then
        remove the rim. Using a clean sharp knife, cut into slices for serving.
        For neat slices, wipe the knife clean and dip into warm water between
        each slice.
        <br />
        Serve cheesecake with desired toppings. Cover and store leftover
        cheesecake in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
